	  Encrypted filesystem that operates on the VFS layer.  See
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/ecryptfs.txt> to learn more about
	  eCryptfs.  Userspace components are required and can be
	  obtained from <http://ecryptfs.sf.net>.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ecryptfs.

config ECRYPT_FS_MESSAGING

	help
	  Enables the /dev/ecryptfs entry for use by ecryptfsd. This allows
	  for userspace to wrap/unwrap file encryption keys by other
	  backends, like OpenSSL.

config CRYPTO_DEV_HWCRYPTO_FOR_SDCARD
    bool "Enable Qcom HW crypto for sdcard encryption"
    help
      Enables Qcom HW crypto for sdcard encryption.

	depends on ECRYPT_FS
	help
	  LG provides SD card encryption to protect external SD card data.
	  all created data on the external SD card is automatically encrypted by
	  file system (eCryptfs) before committing it to SD card and all reads
	  automatically decrypt data before returning it to the calling process.
