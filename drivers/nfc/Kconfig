	tristate "NXP PN533 USB driver"
	depends on USB
	help
	  NXP PN533 USB driver.
	  This driver provides support for NFC NXP PN533 devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for PN533 devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (pn533).

config NFC_WILINK
	tristate "Texas Instruments NFC WiLink driver"
	depends on TI_ST && NFC_NCI
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver

config NFC_TRF7970A
	tristate "Texas Instruments TRF7970a NFC driver"
	depends on SPI && NFC_DIGITAL
	help
	  This option enables the NFC driver for Texas Instruments' TRF7970a
	  device. Such device supports 5 different protocols: ISO14443A,
	  ISO14443B, FeLiCa, ISO15693 and ISO18000-3.

	  Say Y here to compile support for TRF7970a into the kernel or
	  say M  to compile it as a module. The module will be called
	  trf7970a.ko.

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_SIM
	tristate "NFC hardware simulator driver"
	help
	  This driver declares two virtual NFC devices supporting NFC-DEP
	  protocol. An LLCP connection can be established between them and
	  all packets sent from one device is sent back to the other, acting as
	  loopback devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_PORT100
	tristate "Sony NFC Port-100 Series USB device support"
	depends on USB
	depends on NFC_DIGITAL
	help
	  This adds support for Sony Port-100 chip based USB devices such as the
	  RC-S380 dongle.

	  If unsure, say N.
