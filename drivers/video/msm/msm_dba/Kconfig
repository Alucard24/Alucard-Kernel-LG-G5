	bool "MSM Display Bridge Abstraction support"
	depends on ARM
	---help---
	  Support for MSM display bridge abstraction interface. MSM display
	  drivers can use the same interface to interact with different third
	  party bridge chips. Drivers implemented for third party bridge chips
	  should support this interface to allow display driver to control the
	  bridge chip. The MSM DBA driver maintains a list of devices supported
	  on the platform and allow clients to register and access these
	  devices.
